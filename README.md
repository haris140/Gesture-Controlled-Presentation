# Gesture-Controlled Presentation

In the dynamic realm of digital presentations having efficient and intuitive control methods is essential. Imagine effortlessly navigating your slides using simple gestures: pointing up to advance and giving a thumbs down to go back. This cutting-edge gesture-controlled presentation system utilizes live webcam feed and harnesses the power of advanced technologies such as MediaPipe’s Hands and Gesture Recognizer solutions integrated with Python’s robust libraries. By accurately recognizing and interpreting hand gestures in real-time this system empowers presenters to manage their slides with ease enhancing the overall presentation experience without relying on traditional clickers or keyboards.
